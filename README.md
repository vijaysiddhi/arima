Time Series Forecasting with ARIMA Model
📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on time series forecasting using the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model. The goal is to analyze historical data, build an optimal ARIMA model, and generate future predictions.


📊 Dataset
The dataset contains time series data related to [mention dataset source, e.g., crude oil prices, stock market trends, sales data, etc.].
Key columns: Date, Value (or relevant variables).
Preprocessing includes handling missing values, stationarity checks, and transformation.


🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
Python
Pandas & NumPy (Data manipulation)
Matplotlib & Seaborn (Visualization)
Statsmodels (ARIMA modeling)
scikit-learn (Feature scaling & performance evaluation)


🔍 Steps Followed
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualized trends, seasonality, and stationarity tests (ADF test).
Data Preprocessing
Differencing and transformations for stationarity.
Model Selection & Tuning
Determined ARIMA (p, d, q) parameters using ACF/PACF plots.
Selected the best model based on AIC/BIC scores.
Model Training & Forecasting
Trained ARIMA and generated forecasts.
Evaluated accuracy with RMSE/MAE metrics.

📈 Results & Insights
The ARIMA model successfully captured the time series trend.
Forecasted values aligned closely with the actual trend.
